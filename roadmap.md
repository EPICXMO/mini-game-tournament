5. **Performance**: 60 FPS target with <200ms network latency

### Success Metrics
- [ ] All 6 mini-games fully functional
- [ ] Tournament mode working with 8 players
- [ ] Cross-platform multiplayer stable
- [ ] Performance targets met on target devices
- [ ] Modular architecture ready for expansion
